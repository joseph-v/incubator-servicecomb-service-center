## Service Center Frontend

This script helps you to make the docker image of service-center frontend present in "<project folder>/frontend" folder.

The script file "<project folder>/scripts/frontend/start_linux.sh" will be the entrypoint for docker container.

### How To Run

This script assumes you have already downloaded all the dependencies using 'gvt restore'.

Make sure service-center application is running and get service-center applications IP and PORT addresses.

Update "<project folder>/frontend/conf/app.conf" with service-center applications IP and PORT address.

Example app.conf file,

	SC_HOST_IP=123.123.123.123
	SC_HOST_PORT=30100
	SC_HOST_MODE=http
	FRONTEND_HOST_IP=0.0.0.0
	FRONTEND_HOST_PORT=30103

Then build docker image of frontend from folder "<project folder>/scripts/docker/build-frontend-image/".

    bash -x build.sh
    
Once the script finishes you will see image scfrontend-dev.tgz in the same directory. 

You can use this this image to load the docker and start using.

Run following command, open Web Browser and connect to URL "http://<HOST_IP>:30103" to view frontend UI.

    docker run -d -p 30103:30103 -t servicecomb/scfrontend

Where HOST_IP is the ip of host machine where docker container for frontend is executing.
